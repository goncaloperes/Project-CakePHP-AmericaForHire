As the Moderator and Founder of [America_ForHire](https://www.reddit.com/r/america_forhire/) - one of the subreddit that belongs to [World_ForHire](https://www.reddit.com/r/world_forhire/) - to serve as a Jobs Board, I have decided to build a system to take care of that using the CakePHP framework.
  Users can register themselves either as an Employer or a Recruiter.
  It has a search box to filter and narrow down job searches by: keywords, location and category.
  The app's User Interface is responsive and it was build using the HTML Kickstart Framework.
